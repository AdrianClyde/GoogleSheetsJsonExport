# GoogleSheetsJsonExport
## Json exporter for Google sheets. 

### How will it export?
I created this for a custom JSON export for a specific format that I needed. 

Sheet names are used for the array of objects name.
Top row's on the sheet are used as headings/keys within the object.

The sheet above will output like:

## How do I use it?
1. Within the sheet you wish to export, click Tools > Script Editor.
2. Paste in the code from this repo's Code.gs file.
3. Save and return to your sheet.
4. A new menu is added called JSON Export.
5. Profit.
